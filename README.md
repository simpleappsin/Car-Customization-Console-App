# Car Customization Console App
* This is a  fun project that was made while waiting in between the classes to see what I could do with arrays.
* You can also download the code, add your own car types, and also play with the arrays too.
* Customizable design.

# About The Project
* This project took my 40 minutes to 1 hour of time.
* I did not have an idea about what to do before I started and while I was sitting my university's engineering building I was watching outside and the colorful passing car gave me this idea.
* If I had enough time I would also try to implement a car visual in the console with the color given by you.

# THANK YOU
* Thank you for reading and checking my project out.
